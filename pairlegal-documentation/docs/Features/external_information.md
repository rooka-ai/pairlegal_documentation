# External information

The external information feature enriches your legal documents by automatically
integrating external data from various authoritative sources. This ensures that
references to companies, statutory provisions, and case law within your documents are
accurate and up-to-date.

## Company information

When a company name is mentioned within a document, the feature cross-references this
mention with data from Companies House and individual credit score databases in selected
jurisdictions.

We also allow you to search for a company in the Companies House by its name or ID
number, via the 'Registers' tab.

Supported for companies in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­,ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°, ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·.

texts. Users are able to access the exact wording of laws referenced within their
documents.
