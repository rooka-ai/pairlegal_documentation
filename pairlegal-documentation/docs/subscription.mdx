# Subscription

There are two types of subscription. Monthly and yearly. The invoice for each
is sent automatically at the end of the subscription cycle.

Subscription typically buys one person from the organization. The user buying the
subscription must be already registered in `SingleDraft`.

During subscription creation the buying user specifies number of seats.
That is the number of users the organization can add to the subscription.
Which particular users should be added to the subscription is done after
the payment is succeeded.

## Adding Users to Subscription

As the user with `Team Admin` role follow the steps at this

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The user who paid the subscription is not automatically added
to the subscription. Do not forgot to add yourself to the subscription as well
when adding other users.
