# Subscription

SingleDraft offers monthly and yearly subscription options, with invoices generated
automatically at the end of each billing cycle.

Each subscription is based on the number of seats your organisation requires.
To purchase a subscription, you must have an existing SingleDraft account.
During the subscription process, you'll specify the number of seats needed - this
determines how many team users can be added to your subscription.

## Adding Users to Subscription

After completing your payment, you'll need to allocate seats to specific team users.
If you have Team Admin privileges, please follow these steps at this
[link](https://singledraft.ai/payment-success) after the payment succeeded.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that the purchaser of the subscription is automatically
added as a user to the subscription.
