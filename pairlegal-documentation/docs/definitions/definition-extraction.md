# Definition tracking

## Overview

Tracking of **definitions** is designed to enhance contract review processes by
providing instant access to definitions and terms previously defined within the
opened legal document. This feature saves you from having to search for definitions and
terms manually by allowing you to open up a split-view.

## Features

- **Term Highlighting:** Terms defined elsewhere in the contract are underlined for
  easy identification. Green underlines indicate that the term is defined in the current
  document with the same capitalization ("Contract" – "Contract"), while yellow underlines
  indicate that the term is defined in a non-matching case ("Contract" – "contract").

- **Quick Access:** Selecting a term opens a dedicated card in the sidebar with its
  definition. From wherever you are in the document, you can quickly access the definition
  location by double clicking on the "split window" icon (see video below).

- **Nested Term Tracking**: Terms within a definition that are also defined in the
  contract are tracked as well and further accessible from each definition card.

## Accessing definitions

1. Open the document in MS Word and turn the plugin on by clicking on a corresponding
  icon in the upper row. Defined terms will be automatically underlined.

2. To view a definition, perform one of the following:

- Hover the underlined term directly within the text for a quick preview of the
definition.
- Select a term in the text to trigger the sidebar.
- Navigate through the sidebar to select a term from a list of "cards" with defined
  terms.

## Viewing definition

Once a term is selected, the plugin will display its definition within the sidebar. If
the term contains nested definitions, they will be displayed within the same card, and
you can access them by clicking on the nested term.

To access all mentions of a given term within the contract, click on the "Occurrences"
tab inside the card.

:::tip Declensions
The plugin supports declensions of defined terms. For example, if the term "Contract" is
defined, the plugin will also recognize "Contracts" as an occurrence of the defined
term.
