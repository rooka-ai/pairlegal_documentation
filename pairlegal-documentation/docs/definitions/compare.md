# Compare

The Compare feature within the definition card allows users to cross-reference the current definition of a term with its previous wording. This functionality ensures consistency and aids in the understanding which model definition of a term is internally preferred.

:::warning Beta Feature
Compare is currently in a beta feature and we support a limited number of content management system (CMS) providers. Feel free to reach out to us, specifying your CMS provider, if you would like to see this feature supported for you.
