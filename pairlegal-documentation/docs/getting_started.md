# Getting started

Thank you for your interest in SingleDraft, the AI contract drafting assistant
integrated into MS Word. Our solution provides a layer of insights over a contract
opened in MS Word:

- connecting information within the document (such as defined terms),
- connecting with external information (such as information from Company House),
- and providing suggestions on model clauses based on the internal database.

SingleDraft is **built with respect for your craft**, leaving you in control of the
document at all times and providing you with the insights you need to make the best
decisions.
