# Getting started

Thank you for your interest in SingleDraft, the AI legal writing assistant
integrated into MS Word. Our solution provides a layer of insights over a contract
opened in MS Word:

- connecting information within the document (such as defined terms),
- connecting with external information (such as information from Company House),
- and providing suggestions on model clauses based on the internal database.

SingleDraft is built with respect for your craft, leaving you in control of the
document at all times and providing you with the insights you need to make the best
decisions.
