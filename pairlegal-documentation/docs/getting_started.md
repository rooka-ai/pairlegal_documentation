# Getting started

You can download the plugin from the [download.rooka.ai](http://download.rooka.ai/) and then create an account directly from the plugin. Once you create the account, you can immediately access all of the features of the plugin. Our sales team will then reach out to discuss any questions you may have, provide a demo, and discuss paramaters of your pilot program.

The plugin is being automatically updated, so you will always have the latest version.

We currently support Windows only, with a Mac version coming in early 2024.

## Security

Our backend is securely hosted by our partner, a CMS provider SingleCase, in the European Union. Please reach out to us with any questions about security. We are happy to discuss our security practices and provide any documentation you may need.

We use a combination of approaches to analyse the opened document. Unless you are accessing generative AI features (as indicated in each case in the plugin), no data leaves our backend. We can provide tailored **self-hosted** solutions for your organization if you have specific security requirements.
