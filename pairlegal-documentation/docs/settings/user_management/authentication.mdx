# Authentication

To use the plugin securely, users must authenticate within the plugin.
There are two methods of authentication:

## Email-Password

This authentication flow requires the user to register with an email and password.

### Steps

1. Click the `Register` button on the plugin login page.
2. Fill in the email and password fields.
3. A verification email will be sent to the user's email (check the spam folder if necessary).
4. In the verification email, click the verification button.
5. Once verified, the user can proceed to log in.
6. Use the same email and password to log in.

## Azure AD

For users who prefer to use enterprise Azure AD authentication.

### Steps

1. Click the `Login` button on the plugin login page.
2. Click the `Microsoft Azure AD` button.
3. Log in with the Azure AD account.
4. A prompt to approve the `Single Draft` application will appear.
5. Approve it, or ask your IT admin to approve it, depending on the user's Azure AD settings.
6. Once approved, the login process is complete.
7. For subsequent logins, no further approval is needed.
