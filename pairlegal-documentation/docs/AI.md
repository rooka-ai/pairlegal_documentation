# AI

We offer options to customize the AI according to your needs.

## Flows

### Chat

A document can be uploaded within the chat, which the user then asks questions about.
Similarly, it is possible to use a general chat, without involving an open document.
The answers, which are based on the document in question, are provided with citations that allow
for an easy checking of parts of the answer against the source text.
Individual conversations are displayed in the plugin as threads.

### 'FastTrack'

For frequent, repetitive actions, you can also use the option to use AI directly from
the opening screen. Several preset actions are offered by default. The answers are, in
addition to the opening screen, also displayed in a separate thread in the Chat tab.

### Adaptive replace

Swap pairs of terms (e.g., "Company" â€“> "Buyers") over a document in a
contextually-aware way. After selecting the pair or pairs, the plugin returns a list of
suggested replacements, which can be individually accepted or rejected.

### Editing selected text

When selecting text in a file, AI can be used to suggest different variations of the text, including translation into another language.
