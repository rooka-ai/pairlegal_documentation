# AI

## Customization

We offer options to customize the AI according to your needs. You can set your own
provider of large language models, or set an overall tone and style of answers by
selecting the appropriate system message. Find more in the Settings tab.

### Chat

A document can be uploaded within the chat, which the user then asks questions about.
Similarly, it is possible to use a general chat, without involving an open document.
The answers, which are based on the document in question, are provided with citations
that allow for an easy checking of parts of the answer against the source text.
Individual conversations are displayed in the plugin in the form of threads.

  allowFullScreen

### Chat shortcuts

For actions you commonly use, create a simple shortcut to trigger the action. You can
start filtering the action by typing '/' in the chat and then selecting the desired
action from the list. You can use keyboard arrows to navigate through the list, and
press Enter to select the action (this will send the prompt directly to the chat).
Alternatively, you can scroll and select the action to paste its content into the input
field, to further edit it.

### 'FastTrack'

For frequent, repetitive actions, you can also use the option to use AI directly from
the opening screen. Several preset actions are offered by default. The answers are, in
addition to the opening screen, also displayed in a separate thread in the Chat tab.

## Adaptive replace

:::warning Coming soon
:::
Swap pairs of terms (e.g., "Company" â€“> "Buyers") over a document in a
contextually-aware way. After selecting the pair or pairs, the plugin returns a list of
suggested replacements, which can be individually accepted or rejected.

## Editing selected text

When selecting text in a file, AI can be used to suggest different variations of the
text, taking into account the context of the file.
See Editing tab for more information.
