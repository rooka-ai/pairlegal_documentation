# AI

Tap into the latest innovations in the field of generative AI right inside MS Word. Choose your preferred model, turn on an optional two-step anonymization process and run any of the available flows.

## Flows

### Adaptive replace

Swap pairs of terms (e.g., "Company" â€“> "Buyers") over a document in a contextually-aware way. After selecting the pair or pairs, the plugin returns a list of suggested replacements, which can be individually accepted or rejected.

### QA

The QA (Question and Answer) functionality allows users to ask natural language questions about the legal document they are working on. The AI analyzes the text and returns answers together with cited sources.

### Playbook

:::warning Coming soon

The Playbook feature is an intelligent guideline enforcement tool that cross-references the content of the document against a set of predefined rules and clauses that constitute your organization's standard practices, ensuring that all drafted contracts are in line with your company's protocols.
