# Security and Privacy

Both we and our users cannot compromise on the security and high standard of
privacy. We are following the industry-standard and have implemented a number
of measures to ensure that your data is safe and secure.

In short:
- no user data is stored on our servers
- no user data is used for training of language or any other models
- no user data is logged by the application
- no user data is shared with third parties
- no tracking between user's data and user's identity
- we apply the least privilege access to logs and user management data
- all communication between plugin and our servers is encrypted with TLS and takes place
  in the EU

## Data reuse

We as well as all chosen third-party providers (of large language models) do
not reuse your data for training of models. We do not use your data for any
other purposes than providing the service to you and we do not save your data
on our servers.

We only access and save the data with your permission once you file a support
request and toggle the "Share document" switch. We use this data only to
provide you with support and to improve our service, all personnel involved in
this process are bound by confidentiality agreements.

## Novel technology backed by proven practices

Our backend is built within [SingleCase](https://www.singlecase.com/)
infrastructure, allowing us to benefit from their >10 years of experience in
providing secure and reliable services to the legal industry. We are using the
latest technology to provide you with the best possible experience, while
ensuring that the security is based on proven and tested solutions.

## We won't contact you asking for your password

We will never ask you to provide us with your password.
If you forget your password, you can reset it.

## Request custom agreement

If your IT team requires a custom agreement or documentation, please reach out
