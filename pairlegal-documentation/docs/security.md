# Security and privacy

Both we and our users cannot compromise on the security and high standard of privacy.
We are following the industry-standard and have implemented a number of measures to
ensure that your data is safe and secure. In short: no data is stored on our servers, no
data is used for training of language or any other models, we do not know which user is
making a given request, all communication is encrypted and takes place in the EU by
default.

## Data reuse

We as well as all chosen third-party providers (of large language models) do not reuse
your data for training of models. We do not use your data for any other purposes than
providing the service to you and we do not save your data on our servers.

We only access and save the data with your permission once you file a support request
and toggle the "Share document" switch. We use this data only to provide you with
support and to improve our service, all personnel involved in this process are bound by
confidentiality agreements.

## Novel technology backed by proven practices

Our backend is built within [SingleCase](https://www.singlecase.com/) infrastructure,
allowing us to benefit from their >10 years of experience in providing secure and
reliable services to the legal industry. We are using the latest technology to provide
you with the best possible experience, while ensuring that the security is based on
proven and tested solutions.
