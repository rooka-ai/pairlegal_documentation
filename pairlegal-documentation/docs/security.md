# Security and Privacy

Both we and our users cannot compromise on the security and high standard of
privacy. We are following the industry-standard and have implemented a number
of measures to ensure that your data is safe and secure.

In short:

- no user data is by default stored on our servers (unless you decide to use the
  templates or snippets functionality with your own data)
- no user data is used for training of language or any other models
- no user data is logged by the application, only telemetry data is collected
  for the purpose of improving the service
- no user data is shared with third parties
- no tracking between user's data and user's identity
- we apply the least privilege access to logs and user management data
- all communication between plugin and our servers is encrypted with TLS and takes place
  in the location of your choice (we also offer options for EU or Switzerland)

## Data reuse

We as well as all chosen third-party providers (of large language models) do
not reuse your data for training of models. We do not use your data for any
other purposes than providing the service to you and we do not save your data
on our servers.

We only access and save the data with your permission once you file a support
request and manually send us the document. We use this data only to
provide you with support and to improve our service, all personnel involved in
this process are bound by confidentiality agreements.

## Novel technology backed by proven practices

Our backend is built in cooperation with [SingleCase](https://www.singlecase.com/),
allowing us to benefit from their >10 years of experience in
providing secure and reliable services to the legal industry. We are using the
latest technology to provide you with the best possible experience, while
ensuring that the security is based on proven and tested solutions.

## We won't contact you asking for your password

We will never ask you to provide us with your password.
If you forget your password, you can reset it.

## Request custom agreement

If your IT team requires a custom agreement or documentation, please reach out
to us.
