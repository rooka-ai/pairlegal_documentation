# AI assistant

Natively integrated into MS Word, using the knowledge of your internal data and the
context of the opened document, the AI assistant allows for targeted and context-aware
answers.

## Tailored to you

We offer a range of customization options for the AI assistant. You can choose your
preferred language model and its provider, set the overall tone and style of answers,
save and reuse workflows using 'Shortcuts'. In addition, AI uses in the background the
context of the opened document, as well as to your internal data that you have
uploaded.

## Bulk edits

The AI assistant can be used to edit the opened document. You can select the text you
want to edit and the AI will suggest changes, again informed by the context of the
opened document and your internal data. You can then accept or reject the individual
suggested changes.

## Q&A

Answers, which are based on the opened document, are provided with citations that
allow for an easy checking of parts of the answer against the source text.

## Shortcuts

For actions you commonly use, create a simple shortcut to trigger the action. You can
start filtering the action by typing '/' in the chat and then selecting the desired
action from the list. You can use keyboard arrows to navigate through the list, and
press Enter to select the action (this will send the prompt directly to the chat).
Alternatively, you can scroll and select the action to paste its content into the input
field, to further edit it.
