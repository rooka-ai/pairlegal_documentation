# Snippets

Find useful clauses in your internal database and add them to your document.

## How to Use Snippets

### Semantic Search

In the background, our search system finds relevant clauses in two ways:

- **Keyword search**: Finds exact words you type
- **Meaning-based search**: Understands the context and meaning of what you need

This combined approach helps you find the most useful clauses, even when they use
different words to express the same idea.

### Automatic Filters

The system automatically adds information to your documents, such as:

- Language (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Party names
- Document type

This lets you narrow down search results without manual tagging. As you select filters,
both the results and other filter options update automatically.

### Personal Organization

- **Favorites**: Mark clauses you use often for quick access
- **Tags**: Add labels to clauses so your team can find them easily

### Easy Document Interaction

- **Search by Selection**: Drag text from your document to the search bar to find
  similar clauses
- **Compare Text**: Drag text between your document and search results to see
  differences (redline comparison)
