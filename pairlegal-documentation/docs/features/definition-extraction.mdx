# Definition Tracking

This feature helps you find and understand defined terms in your legal documents.
Instead of searching through the entire document to find what a term means,
the system shows you the definition right away.

## Main Benefits

### Quick Access to Definitions

- Select any defined term to see its meaning in the sidebar
- Jump to where the term is defined in the document by clicking the "split window" icon
- Find definitions from anywhere in your document

### Smart Definition Connections

- When a definition contains other defined terms, these are highlighted
- Click on any highlighted term to see its definition too

### Checks

The system alerts you about:

- Defined terms that are never used in the document
- Terms defined more than once
- Inconsistent capitalization (example: defining "Agreement" but later writing "agreement")
- You can dismiss any alert you do not need

### Definition Comparison

- Compare definitions with those in your other documents
- Requires connecting your internal files first

## How to Use Definition Tracking

### Step 1: Enable the Feature

Open your document in MS Word and click the plugin icon in the top row.
The system will automatically find all defined terms.

### Step 2: View Definitions

You can see definitions in two ways:

- Select a term directly in your document text
- Browse the list of defined terms in the "cards" tab
- Use the search bar to find specific terms

## Understanding Definition Cards

When you select a term, you'll see a card in the sidebar showing:

- The complete definition of the term
- Any other defined terms within that definition (highlighted)
- An "Occurrences" tab that shows all places where the term appears in your document

:::tip Word Forms
The system recognizes different forms and declensions of the same word. For example,
if "Contract" is defined, it will also find "Contracts" in your document.
