# Definition tracking

## Overview

Tracking of **definitions** is designed to enhance contract review by providing access
to definitions and terms previously defined within the opened legal document. This
feature saves you from having to search for definitions manually.

## Features

- **Quick Access:** Selecting a term opens a dedicated card in the sidebar with its
  definition. From wherever you are in the document, you can quickly access the definition
  location by clicking on the "split window" icon (see video below).

- **Nested Term Tracking**: Terms within a definition that are also defined in the
  contract are tracked as well and further accessible from each definition card.

- **Alerts**: We check for consistency of defined terms and alert you on defined terms
  that are not subsequently used, duplicate definitions, or inconsistent use of the term
  throughout the document (such as defining a word with capital letter to then refer to it
  in lowercase). All individual alerts can be dismissed.

- **Compare**: Once you connect your internal files, you can compare the definition
  with the definitions of the same term in other documents.

## Accessing definitions

1. Open the document in MS Word and turn the plugin on by clicking on a corresponding
   icon in the upper row. Defined terms will be automatically recognized and displayed
   in the "cards" tab.

2. To view a term's definition, perform one of the following:

- Select a term in the text to trigger the sidebar; or
- Navigate through the sidebar to select a term from a list of "cards" with defined
  terms; you can also use the search bar to find a specific term.

## Viewing definition

Once a term is selected, the plugin will display its definition within the sidebar. If
the term contains nested definitions, they will be highlighted within the same card, and
you can access them by clicking on the nested term.

To access all mentions of a given term within the contract, click on the "Occurrences"
tab inside the card.

:::tip Declensions
The plugin supports declensions of defined terms. For example, if the term "Contract" is
defined, the plugin will also recognize "Contracts" as an occurrence of the defined
term.
