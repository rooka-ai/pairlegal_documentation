# Blocks

The Blocks feature helps you add pre-made text sections to your documents.
These sections can be:

- Placeholder text (like [*], [◆], or [...])
- Signature pages for document signing

Blocks are accessible via the extended menu in the SingleDraft plugin, in the top left
corner of the plugin, under the grid of squares icon.

### Adding Placeholder Blocks

You can add different types of placeholder symbols:

- Asterisk [*]
- Square [■]
- Circle [●]
- Underline [_]
- Diamond [◆]
- Ellipsis [...]
- Triple underline [___]
- Triple diamond [◆◆◆]

Or you can add your own custom text inside the placeholder block by selecting "Add
custom text", to get e.g., [__TBA__].

### Adding Signature Pages

To add signature blocks:

1. Click on "Signatures" at the top
2. Adjust the content of the signature block to your needs
3. Choose how many signature blocks you need
4. Click "Insert a signature" to add them to your document
