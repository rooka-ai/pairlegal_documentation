# External information

The external information feature enriches your legal documents by automatically
integrating external data from various authoritative sources. This ensures that
references to companies, statutory provisions, and plots of land within your documents
are accurate and up-to-date.

## Company information

When a company name is mentioned within a document, the feature cross-references this
mention with data from Companies House and individual credit score databases in selected
jurisdictions.

We also allow you to search for a company in the Companies House by its name or ID
number, via the 'Registers' tab.

Supported for companies in ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­,ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡°, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡·.

## Statutory information

This feature links mentions of statutory provisions directly to their corresponding
texts. Users are able to access the exact wording of laws referenced within their
documents.

## Land Registry

For the parcels mentioned in the text, we display the available information from the
Land Registry, checking their existence and the correct type of parcel in the text.
