## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Search

1. **Basic Search with Keywords**
   You can search with or without using filters. Let's start by simply typing a few
   words in the search bar, e.g., `contractual penalty`. Using a combination of
   traditional and semantic search, SingleDraft will find the most relevant parts
   of your documents that match the search query. These can include clauses with
   the same wording (e.g., `contractual penalty`), or clauses with just similar
   meaning (e.g., `fines`).

   During free trial, you have access to a limited number of publicly available
   documents. To sync with your documents, please see
   [this guide](/docs/settings/integrations).

2. **Basic Filtering**
   In case you want to narrow down the search results, you can use the filters.
   The values used for filtering are automatically extracted from the source
   documents by us when syncing. You do not have to manually sort or tag your
   documents.

   Let's say you want to find clauses about penalties only in English. You can
   select `English` in the language filter.

3. **Advanced Filtering**
   You can also use advanced filters to narrow down the search results. For
   example, you can filter by `Document Type` or `Governing Law`. Perhaps you need
   clauses in English, but from past contracts governed by German law. You can
   select `English` in the language filter and `German` in the governing law
   filter.

   As you are adding filters, the options for the remaining filters change to
   reflect the current selection. Therefore, once you select the filters above, other
   filters reflect this and show only the options that are now available.

   You can therefore even at this stage check, that English clauses from German
   contracts are matching only some document types that have both of these
   characteristics.

4. **Search by dropping an existing clause**
   You can also search by dropping a part of text from the document into the search bar.
   This will automatically find similar clauses in your documents.

   In our example, if you are interested in a clause about penalties, you can
   simply drag and drop an existing clause into the search bar.

### 2. Compare Clauses

To compare a part of an existing text from a document with a clause from the
search results, you can simply drag and drop the clause from the document into
the search results.

### 3. Intelligent Filter Suggestions

If you type a query that would benefit from a filter, we will suggest the most
relevant filters for you. For example, if you search for
`contractual penalty written last year`, we will suggest the `Date` filter.

### 4. Personal and Team Organization

#### My List

You can save any snippet found into your personal lists. These lists are visible
only to you and can be used as filters in your searches.

#### Tags

You can also add tags to your snippets. These tags are visible to all team members
and can be used to organize or comment on your snippets.

### 5. Integration with Other Features

#### Definition Lookup

In the [Checks](/docs/features/checks) feature, all defined terms from the current
documents can be easily used as a filter to find snippets from past documents containing
alternative definitions.

#### AI Assistant Integration

The [AI Assistant](/docs/features/AI) can also tap into your internal
knowledge base to provide you with the most relevant edit suggestions.
