# Speed Up Your Drafting

SingleDraft enhances your drafting process with intelligent features and external data
integration. Learn how to draft documents faster while maintaining quality.

## Definition tracking

SingleDraft automatically finds all defined terms in your documents and tracks their
usage throughout the document. With **custom highlights** over text, you can quickly
see which term is defined elsewhere in the document and whether the usage of the defined
term is consistent. See [Definition Tracking](/docs/features/definition-extraction) for
more information.

## External information

Lookup useful information from third-party sources, depending on the jurisdiction of
the document. In addition to a reactive search, you can also proactively fetch
information from the company registry. In the submenu, go to the **Registries** tab
and type the company name or ID for the supported jurisdictions.
See [External Information](/docs/features/external_information) for more information.

## Blocks

Use pre-defined blocks to speed up your drafting. In your test document, scroll down
to where you would like to insert signature block, set up the number of signatories,
and click on the signature block. It will be inserted into the document. See
[Blocks](/docs/features/blocks) for more information.

## AI assistant

To speed up your drafting, you can ask the AI assistant to iterate on a clause for you
or extract useful information from a document in a table-like or other preferred format.
See [AI Assistant](/docs/features/AI) for more information.
