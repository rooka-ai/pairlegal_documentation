## Prompt library

Current large language models benefit from an increased context and precise
instructions. You can save your custom long-form prompts in the prompt library and
then reuse them in the chat.

To save this shortcut, click on the `/` button in the chat, and scroll down to
`Add new shortcut`. As an example, let's add the following prompt:

Name: `penalty`

Full-prompt:

```text
Is there a penalty clause in this contract? Please also include any other clauses
that are relevant to penalties or are functionally equivalent. At the end, please
sum up the conditions for a penalty in a table. Cite sources.
```

You can now use this shortcut by typing `/penalty` in the chat. Once you type
`/p`, the shortcuts are being filtered to show you those matching your input.

## Wide range of models

We offer a wide range of models to choose from, including latest large language
models, as well as DeepL for translation. See the full list of models in the
[Settings](/docs/settings/external_services/#selection-of-ai-models).

## Context-awareness

The AI assistant uses the context of the opened document, as well as your internal
data that you have uploaded. To explicitly add the currently opened document to the
context, you can use the `Add document to context` button in the chat.

## Custom style

You can influence and customize the style of all the AI answers by giving it a general
overview of your preferred tone or context about your firm.

Set the style by clicking on the corresponding dropdown in the chat window.

## Using your own internal data

AI benefits from learning from your past writing. As such, we being asked to rewrite
a clause, AI can tap into your [Snippet Library](/docs/features/snippets) to find
similar clauses and use them as context.
