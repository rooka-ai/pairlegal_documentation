# Avoiding Formal Mistakes

SingleDraft prevents common mistakes before they become issues.

## Key Features for Error Prevention

### Automated rules

We check for a wide range of common mistakes (see
[List of checks](/docs/features/checks) for a full list). In your test document, go
to the **Checks** tab to see the results of these checks, including incorrect
cross-references, invalid IBANs, and more.

### External data validation

In addition to our own checks, we also validate against fetched external data. For
example, we can check if a company name is valid, its registered address matches
the address in the document, and more. In your test document, you can check the
information regarding the mentioned company as it is validated against the company
registry.

### AI-based checks

For more complex grammar and formal errors, you can use the
[AI assistant](/docs/features/AI). Common use-cases include typos in the
text (available under `/typos`). In your test document, go over the results and
individually accept or reject the suggested corrections.
