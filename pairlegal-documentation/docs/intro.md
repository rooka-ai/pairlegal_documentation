`This is markdown`

## @Jan

- You can edit this documentation by editing the files in the 'docs' folder on github
- You can create multiple sections by creating folders in the 'docs' folder
- The sidebar_position in each markdown file is relative to its section
- Add images by putting the files into the /img/ subdir of a section and referencing them in the markdown
- the _category_.json is what users see when you send them a link to this documentation + the sidebar_position in this file is for the higher level order of the sections
